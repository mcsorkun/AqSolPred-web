# About AqSolPred

AqSolPred is an highly accurate solubility prediction model that consists consensus of 3 ML algorithms (Neural Nets, Random Forest, and XGBoost). AqSolPred is developed using a quality-oriented data selection method described in [1] and trained on AqSolDB [2] largest publicly available aqueous solubility dataset.

AqSolPred showed a top-performance (0.348 LogS Mean Absolute Error) on Huuskonen benchmark dataset [3].

# AqSolPred Web Version

Currently, web version is running on Streamlit Share (the related repository is inside streamlit folder). 
You can visit from the following URL: https://share.streamlit.io/mcsorkun/aqsolpred-web/main/streamlit/app.py

**aqsolpred web version:** 1.0s (lite version of v1.0 described in the paper with reduced RFs(n_estimators=200,max_depth=10) but the same performance)

If you are using the predictions from AqSolPred on your work, please cite these papers: [1, 2]

**Special thanks:** This web app is developed based on the tutorials and the template of [DataProfessor's repository](https://github.com/dataprofessor/code/tree/master/streamlit/part7). 

**Note:** Main folder was prepared for Heroku deployment, however it passes the Heroku slug size therefore it is not online on heroku.  

**PS:** Check out dockerfile in gcloud folder to know how I installed conda + rdkit on google cloud platform.
